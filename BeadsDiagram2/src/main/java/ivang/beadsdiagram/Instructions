    Press shift when creating or rotating a bead to snap it to 45-degree angle multiples.
    Click a bead to select it and change its strength sliders.

String manipulation
    Click "New String" button to create a new string.
    Click "Delete Selected" button to delete currently selected string.
    Choose a string you want to edit.
    First text field is through which beads the string will go through.
    Second text field is what offsets to give to the string passing through the corresponding bead.
    Click "Apply" to modify the string.
    Example input: "1,2,3,-1" "5,0,10,-5"; it will draw a line from 1 to 2 to 3 to 1 from front to back, and when going
        through 1, the string will be offset by a bit up/down.
    Offsets should be in range (10,-10) (or they will look really bad using my method of drawing strings).
        Good positions are: -10,-5,0,5,10. This way there are 5 distinguishable lines max to pass through a bead.
    If offsets field is empty, all 0's will be assumed
