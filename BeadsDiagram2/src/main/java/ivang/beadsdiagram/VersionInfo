BeadsDiagram2 version 0.6

This version is hard limited to 1 window, so if several windows needed, a lot of code has to be rearranged.
I'm still considering changing from beads having their own strength sliders to every line having a separate
    set of strength sliders for each bead it's going through. It will require me to rewrite like 50% of code.
UI uses Google Gson Library to convert Java Objects to JSON and wise versa.
Bezier curves are cubic and use: first bead, it's up point, second bead's down point, second bead; as its 4 points.
Kind of obvious, but translate level must not contain any additional information to model level that is required to
    draw a diagram. All information required to draw a diagram must be stored on model level.

What's new:
    Can only edit one bead at a time (hides other beads' strength sliders).
    Can save/load files, finally.
    Added buttons to Save/Load from "test" file.
    When offsets are >10, they look fine now.

Plan:
    Set up a gitignore file.
    Update comments.
    Reorganize functions (such as delete duplicate functions with one or two different lines
        or create new functions for better organization).
    Crop image.
    See if turning/cropping/etc of the image should be changed.
    Draw lines even if they are empty (or not, idk).
    Allow to modify only selected string (endpoints).
    Change Save/Load to key presses instead of buttons

The program is divided into 3 levels:
1) model
    It might change slightly, such as Bead using VPoint to store its location or something.
    I still don't know what's the best way of doing things even on this level.
    Model stores the information on basic level.

    Bead - Just stores its position, rotation and the points of bezier curves for strings going in either direction.
    Line - Stores beads that this string is going through, endpoints and offsets in the beads.
        Beads are stored as numbers (indexes in the array of DiagramManager) which is kind of arbitrary (not great).
    VPoint - (Virtual Point) - Stores (x,y) position. In this version it's only used to store endpoints of Line.
    DiagramManager - Contains protected arrays of beads and lines(strings).
        Provides functionality to manipulate either one.
        All interactions with diagram should theoretically be done through this manager.

2) translate
    All classes in this level extend their counterparts in Model. UI level should interact with only this level.
    Provide more/more useful functionality for UI level (for drawing, interacting; less abstract).

    JBead - (Java Bead) - Most notably, has upP/downP points which are the points for bezier curves
        and updates them automatically.
    JLine - (Java Line) - Pretty much same as Line, but uses JPoints instead of VPoints.
    JPoint - (Java Point) - Same as Point with the exception of additional functions.
    JManager - (Java Diagram Manager) - Provides most of the same functionality as normal DiagramManager.
        Uses JBead and JLine instead of Bead and Line.

3) ui
    This level uses translate level to draw the diagram and let user interact with it.

    Display - Contains main function. Creates/Loads a diagram in form of JManager and calls to Drawer to draw.
    Drawer - Has timer that repaints MyFrame every once in a while (limiting frame rate).
    Window - Set up a Frame that contains Workspace and Layout.
    Workspace - A panel that the diagram is drawn on. It's supposed to be extended by other class (UI class)
        to implement specific behaviors (what exactly happens when the user drag clicks or left clicks?).
    UI - (User Interface) - Implements MyPanel's methods. Slightly abstracted from AWT.
    Layout - All buttons and other UI (not UI class lol) needed (mostly for lines(strings))
    FileManager - Can (should) save/load diagram in a file storing it in JSON format.
        It should save DiagramManager (more abstract, only information required to draw a diagram),
        but load JManager (more useful for drawing, used in ui level), and I'm not sure how to make it work.
        Right now it's broken because of how FileManager loads Bead and Line, but later they are being casted to
        JBead and JLine (I get ClassCastException), if I understand correctly.

Additionally, there is a Util class which provides a few mathematical functions.
