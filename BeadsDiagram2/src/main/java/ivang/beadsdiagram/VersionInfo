BeadsDiagram2 version 0.1

In this version you can create/delete beads, but there is no way to add strings(lines) except for hardcoding in Display.
    I'm planning to use area under workspace to allow user to manipulate strings(lines).
This version is hard limited to 1 window, so if several windows needed, a lot of code has to be rearranged.
UI uses Google Gson Library to convert Java Objects to JSON and wise versa.
Bezier curves are quadratic and use: first bead, it's up point, second bead's down point, second bead; as its 4 points.
Kind of obvious, but translate level must not contain any additional information to model level that is required to
    draw a diagram. All information required to draw a diagram must be stored on model level.
FileManager is broken in this version.

What's new:
    Now Workspace is not the only thing present in the window (MyFrame). I figured out how to
        create buttons and stuff and example is added.
    Whenever mouse is not in workspace, nothing will happen when clicking.

Plan:
    Create a new class that will hold all UI needed to manipulate strings which will be under the main workspace.
    Set up a gitignore file.

To fix:
    FileManager

The program is divided into 3 levels:
1) model
    It might change slightly, such as Bead using VPoint to store its location or something.
    I still don't know what's the best way of doing things even on this level.
    Model stores the information on basic level.

    Bead - Just stores its position, rotation and the points of bezier curves for strings going in either direction.
    Line - Stores beads that this string is going through, endpoints and offsets in the beads.
        Beads are stored as numbers (indexes in the array of DiagramManager) which is kind of arbitrary (not great).
    VPoint - (Virtual Point) - Stores (x,y) position. In this version it's only used to store endpoints of Line.
    DiagramManager - Contains protected arrays of beads and lines(strings).
        Provides functionality to manipulate either one.
        All interactions with diagram should theoretically be done through this manager.

2) translate
    All classes in this level extend their counterparts in Model. UI level should interact with only this level.
    Provide more/more useful functionality for UI level (for drawing, interacting; less abstract).

    JBead - (Java Bead) - Most notably, has upP/downP points which are the points for bezier curves
        and updates them automatically.
    JLine - (Java Line) - Pretty much same as Line, but uses JPoints instead of VPoints.
    JPoint - (Java Point) - Same as Point with the exception of additional functions.
    JManager - (Java Diagram Manager) - Provides most of the same functionality as normal DiagramManager.
        Uses JBead and JLine instead of Bead and Line.

3) ui
    This level uses translate level to draw the diagram and let user interact with it.

    Display - Contains main function. Creates/Loads a diagram in form of JManager and calls to Drawer to draw.
    Drawer - Has timer that repaints MyFrame every once in a while (limiting frame rate).
    MyFrame - Set up a Frame that contains MyPanel.
    MyPanel - A panel that the diagram is drawn on. It's supposed to be extended by other class (UI class)
        to implement specific behaviors (what exactly happens when the user drag clicks or left clicks?).
    UI - (User Interface) - Implements MyPanel's methods. Slightly abstracted from AWT.
    FileManager - Can (should) save/load diagram in a file storing it in JSON format.
        It should save DiagramManager (more abstract, only information required to draw a diagram),
        but load JManager (more useful for drawing, used in ui level), and I'm not sure how to make it work.
        Right now it's broken because of how FileManager loads Bead and Line, but later they are being casted to
        JBead and JLine (I get ClassCastException), if I understand correctly.

Additionally, there is a Util class which provides a few mathematical functions.
